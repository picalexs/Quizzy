(Integral ﬂow theorem) If all capacities in R are integer then there exists
an integral flow, w, of maximum value (all {Ii-U‘ 6 Z+). ‘
Proof. Let us consider the following algorithm:

$0 <— 0; 1L P 0;

While (ElPi an augmenting path W. r. t. mi) do

will <- rni ® r(P¢); i+ +;

end While
Note that "xi has only integral components" is an invariant of the algo-
rithm (from the deﬁnition of r(PZ-), if all capacities are integral and :zzi
is integral, then r(P1~) is integral and hence mi“ is integral). /

end if
if (ji G E and mﬁ' > O) then
labelj by e : (2', backward,min{e3[i], wig);
end if
end for
The meaning of the components of labels is maintained by the procedure
scan.
When, in the procedure scan, the vertex t is labeled, an augmenting
path P, W.r.t. the current flow x, is discovered in the following way:
—

These drawbacks of the algorithm can be avoided if the choosing of
the labeled vertices for scanning is made in a smart way (Dinic (1970),
Edmonds 8: Karp (1972)).
A shortest augmenting path w.r.t. the ﬂow a; in R is an augmenting
path of minimum length over a1] augmenting paths w.r.t. m.
Let a: be a flow in the flow network R. Let wk (k; 2 1) be the ﬂows from
the sequence:

m1 <- m;

wk“ <— wk ® 7*(Pk), Pk being a shortest augmenting path w.r.t. wk;

—

Edmonds 8z Karp modiﬁcation of Ford 8z Fulkerson algorithm

Any augmenting path has at least one critical arc. Hence in the sequence
(Pk) we have at most mn / 2 shortest augmenting paths.

Corollary ‘
In any ﬂow network there 1's a flow a: with the property that there 1's no
augmenting path w.r.t. :n.

Remarks ‘

a The proof of the Theorem 4 is now completed.

o The only change in the is the choice of
the labeled vertex which will be scanned: use the rule "ﬁrst labeled-
ﬁrst scanned" that is, maintain a queue of labeled vertices initialized
at each flow augmentation with the source s. ,

The constraints (ii) veriﬁed by a: - are not affected for 1:1 in a vertex

Proof cont’d. Moreover, in each While iteration the value of the current

flow increases (with at least one), therefore the algorithm terminates in

at most c({s}, V \ {3}) E Z+ while iterations.

There is no augmenting paths vv.r.t. the ﬁnal ﬂow, hence, by Theorem

7"(P) is the component e3 of the label of t, its vertices can be found in
0(n) time by exploring the ﬁrst component of the labels, and the change
ac ® 'I‘(P) is done in this exploration by using the second component of
the labels.
For the new ﬂow, a new labeling based search is considered.
If all labeled vertices have been scanned and the vertex t has not been
labeled, it follows that w. r. t. the current flow there is no augmenting
path in R, therefore the current flow it is of maximum value. If S is the
set of labeled vertices and T : V \ S, then (S, T) is a cut of minimum
capacity in R.

The algorithm maintains a labeling of the network's vertices in order to

ﬁnd the augmenting paths with respect to the current flow z. When

there is no augmenting path, the flow ac is of maximum value.

Let R : (G : (V, E), s, t, c) a network ﬂow and :c a ﬂow in R.

The label of a vertex j, that has three components (e1, e2, e3), has the

following meaning: there exists an A-path from s t0 j, P, Where e1 : z'

is the predecessor of j on this path, e2 E {forward, backward} is the

direction of arc ij, and e3 : 'r(P).

Initially s is labeled (-, -, oo). The other vertices receive labels by scan-

ning the already labeled vertices: J

z'j is a backward arc in Pk. Then of : 011-“ + 1, in Pl z'j will be forward

It follows a]; +le : aid-1+7‘; 2 (If + 1 +1‘; : 0;“ +731“ +2. We obtained

that length(Pl) Z length(Pk) + 2.

Hence any shortest augmenting path on which the arc z'j is critical has

the length with at least 2 greater than the length of the precedent path

on which ij has been critical. Since the length of a path in G is at most

n — 1, it follows that a ﬁxed arc can not be critical more than n / 2 times

(in the whole augmentation process). ‘

(Max ﬁow - Min cut theorem) The maximum value of a ﬁow in the ﬁow

Line of proof. If we devise an algorithm that, starting from an initial
ﬁow m0 (e.g., m0 : 0), constructs in ﬁnite time a ﬂow :r: with respect
to which there is no augmenting paths, then the cut considered in the
proof of Theorem 1 satisﬁes together with ac the required equality. For
rational capacities, the algorithm considered in the proof of Theorem 2
satisﬁes this condition. For arbitrary real capacities we will present later
such an algorithm due to Edmonds and Karp (1972).

o A short proof of the above theorem is to show that there is a flow
of maximum value and to apply the construction in the proof of
Theorem 1. A ﬂow of maximum value exists always by observing
that it is the optimal solution of a linear program (over a non-empty
polytope).
a The algorithmic importance of Theorem 3 is given by the fact that
the set of all cuts in the network is ﬁnite, Whereas the set of all flovvs

Time complexity: Each ﬂovv augmenting requires at most 2m(m : |E|)
arc inspections for doing vertex labeling. If all capacities are integers,
at most 'u augmentations ('u being the value of the maximum flow) are
required. Hence the algorithm has (9(mv) time complexity.
If U is an upper bound of all arc capacities, then v g (n — 1) U (this is
an upper bound of the capacity of the cut ({s}, V \ {s})), therefore the
algorithm has (9(nmU) time complexity.
—
The algorithm may not terminate for irrational capacities. This case
does not arise in practical implementations, but the weakness of the
algorithm is given by the fact that the number of ﬂovv augmentings may
depend on the capacities values (and not the size of the network). ‘

Proof (cont’d). Since ij is a critical arc in Pk , in mk+1 it can not be
used in the same direction as in Pk. Let Pl (with l > k) be the ﬁrst
