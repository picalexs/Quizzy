Matchings

Deﬁnition 4

Matching (independent set of edges) in G : (V, E): M Q E such that

forall e,f€M,1'fe;éf, then eﬁfzﬁ.

In more words, M Q E is a matching if each pair of its edges share no

endpoint. i

Notation

The maximum cardinality of a matching in G is called the matching

number (edge-independence number) of G and is denoted by 1/(G).

Exercise 8’. (exercise 8 cont’d) A smart and skilled programmer is won-
dering if the two NP-hard problems in the above exercise can be solved
in polynomial time since the graph constructed seems to belong to a
very special class of graphs.

(a) Prove that for any graph, G, there is an input for the scheduling

problem above such that the graph constructed is G.

The programmer suggests the following "greedy approachII to solve the
second question in exercise 8: starting with day 1, a maximum number
of exams are scheduled (from the set of exams not scheduled) daily, until
all exams are scheduled.

b) Show that this greedy strategy can fail, by giving a counterexample.

Exercise 9’. (exercise 9 cont’d) A student is wondering if the above
questions (which correspond to NP-hard problems) can be answered by
polynomial time algorithms since the graph constructed seems to belong
to a very special class of graphs.

(a) Prove that for any graph G there is an input for the registry allo-

cation problem such that the resulted graph is G.

The student suggests the following “greedy approach" to answer the
second question in exercise 9: starting with the ﬁrst step, allocate as
many as possible variables to one new free register in each step, until
there are no more variables.

(b) Show that this greedy approach fails, by giving a counterexample.

Objectives:
The lectures Will cover basic topics in Algorithmic Graph Theory. Accu-
mulated knowledge will be applied in designing efﬁcient algorithms for
combinatorial optimization problems.
Lectures: E. F. Olariu (halfyear A and E), C. Frasinaru (halfyear B).

sponding seminars.

Grading:

o Seminar. Each test is a question whose not too long answer needs
a justiﬁcation.

o Homeworks. The solutions can be worked in teams of up to four
students (each being leader/responsible for at least one problem
from the corresponding set). Solutions will be written in LaTeX
or Word (Write) and electronically sent (both the source and the
corresponding .pdf). 2 points bonus for each homework written in
LaTeX. The solution will be checked using an anti-plagiarism tool,
the grades of the students which will copy will be penalised (for
each copied problem the student will receive —2 points only).

o Written ﬁnal test (compulsory). The students cannot use course
related materials during the test. .

Graphs are used for analyzing social/news networks (like Facebook or
Twitter) in order to ﬁnd characteristics like:
o the level of connectivity, the density;
o the inﬂuence of users within the network (centrality, the social net-
working potential);
o the level of segmentation: measuring the clusterization;
o robustness or structural stability of the network.
The network analysis is then used for
o data mining and aggregation, marketing;
o behavior analysis and network prediction;
o intelligence and security analysis (surveillance of terrorism and or-
ganized crime) etc.

o Matchings: assignment problems, in computational chemistry and
mathematical chemistry studies on organic materials.

Graph isomorphism
Deﬁnition 7
Two graphs G1 : (V1, E1) and G2 : (V2, E2) are if there is
a bijection <p : V1 —> V2 such that for every two vertices u1,'01 G V1,
ul and '01 are adjacent 1'n G1 (i. e., ul'ul G E1) if and only if <p(u1) and
<p('u1) are adjacent in G2 (1'. e., <p(u1)<p('u1) € E2).
In other words two graphs are isomorphic if there is a bijection between
their sets of vertices which induces a bijection between their sets of
edges.

Exercise 9. A compiler optimization is the register allocation technique:

the most used variables are kept in the fast processor registers in order

to have them there at the moment when the compiler needs them (for

certain operations made by CPU).

Design a graph that - by using its appropiate parameters - will answer

to the following questions:

(a) What is the maximum number of variables which are not needed at

the same time?

(b) What is the minimum number of registries needed?

Hint: We have two kind of objects at hand: variables (with their values)

and CPU operations (or operators) which use one or more variables. ,

—

Exercise 7. Two students, L(azy) and T(hinky), must ﬁnd a particu-
lar path between two given vertices in a sparse graph G: |E(G)| :
O(]V(G)\). L judge that, since the graph is sparse, the number of
paths between the two vertices is small, and a lazy solution is to gen-
erate (backtracking) all these paths and than retain the wanted one.
T does not agree and gives the following example: let Hn : K2 >< Pn
(n 2 1); add to Hn two new vertices a: and y each joined by two edges
with one of the two pairs of adjacent vertices in Hn of degree 2.

The obtained graph, Gn, is sparse but the number of paths between ac
and y is big. Explain to L this example by drawing Gn, showing its
sparsity, and ﬁnding the number of paths between a: and y.
