Let us consider the problem of deciding if a given planar graph has a

(vertex) 3-coloring, which is a NP-complete problem.

For a graph G with a small number of vertices (for a constant number

c, we can verify all C(30) : 0(1) functions from V(G) to {1,2,3}) we

can easily decide if it has a 3-coloring.

For planar graphs with the number n of vertices > c, we build in (9(n)

the partition (A,B,S) of its vertex set, with ‘Al, {Bl g (2n/3) and

\Sl g 4W like in the above theorem.

For each of the 3l5| : 20MB) possible functions from S to {1,2,3} we

test if it is a 3-coloring of the subgraph induced by S and if it can be

extended to a 3-coloring of the subgraph induced by AU S in G and also

to a 3-coloring of the subgraph induced by B U S in G (recursively). j

(Tarjan 8c Lipton, 1979) Let G be a planar graph With n vertices. There
is a partition (A, B, S) of V(G) such that:

This partition can be found in (9(n) time. ‘
Proof idea. Let G be a connected plane graph. Perform a bfs traversal
from some vertex s, labeling each vertex 'u by its level in the bfs tree
obtained. Let L(t), the set of all vertices on the level t, for 0 é t é 1+ 1.
The last level L(l + 1) is empty - for technical reasons (the last level is

R3. An embedding of G on S is a graph G’ : (V', E) such that:

Algorithmic proof. We will outline an O(n log n) drawing.

W. l. 0. g., we will assume that G is maximal planar: Ve E E(G),

G + e is not planar (we add edges to G in order to make it maximal

planar and when these additional edges (segments) are drawn they are

invisible). Note that any face of a maximal planar graph is a triangle

and has 3n — 6 edges, where n is its number of vertices.

Let G be a planar graph and G’ be a planar representation of G. If C"

is a cycle of G’ passing through the edge u'u E E(G’), then there exists

w 6 V(C’) such that w 5i u, 'u and there is no interior chord of C’ with

one extremity in w.

Proof. Let 111,112, . . . ,1)" be the vertices of G’ in a traversal of it from 'u,

tov(v:v1,u:'un). I
—

Proof cont’d. By Lemma 1, there exists vk_1 on C,Q_1 such that vk_1 is

not the extremity of an interior chord of C,Q_1.

From the construction, 'uk_1 is not adjacent with external chords of Cléil

(by the maximal planarity). It follows that Gkiz will contain a cycle

Cl;_2 with properties (i) and (ii). U

Proof of the Theorem (Fraysseix, Pach, Pollack). Let G be a maximal

planar graph with n vertices, G’ be a planar representation with vertices

labeled '01, . . . , 'un as in Lemma 2, and u, 'u, 'w its exterior face.

We Will construct a Fary representation of G having as vertices points

of integer coordinates.

In the step k; (2 3) of construction, we have such a representation of Gk

and the following three conditions are fulﬁlled:

Proof cont’d. Each internal level is a separator in G (we have edges only
between consecutive levels). Let t1 the middle level, that is, the level
which contains the Ln/2j-th vertex encountered in the traversal. The

A graph is planar if and only if it has an embedding on a sphere. ‘
Proof. If G is planar, let G’ be a planar representation of G on the plane
1r. Let a: be a point in 1r and consider a sphere 5 tangent to 1r in :n. Let
y the diametral point of a: in S. Consider g0 : 1r —> S \ {y} given by
<p(M) : the point different from y in which the line My intersects the
sphere, VM E 1r. (p is a bijection and therefore <p(G’) is an embedding
of G on 5.

Conversely, if G has an embedding on a sphere 5: take y a point in S“,
consider x, the diametral point of y on S, construct a tangent plane 1r
to Sin w, and deﬁne 1,0 : S\{y} —> 1r by 1/1(N) : the point in which the
line yN intersects the plane 1r, for all N E S \ {y}.
“y is chosen s. t. y Q V(G) U E(G).

Proof cont’d. If f : 1, then G has no cycle and, since it is connected,
it is a tree. It follows that m : n — 1 and the theorem holds.

In the inductive step, suppose that the theorem holds for any connected
plane graph with strictly less than f(> 2) faces. Let e be an edge
belonging to a cycle of G (there is such cycle, since f 2 2). Then
e belongs to the boundary of exactly two faces of G. It follows that
G1 : G — e is a connected plane graph having n vertices, m — 1 edges
and f— 1 faces. The theorem holds for G1, therefore f— 1 : m—1—n+2,
i. e.,f:m—n+2. D

From an algorithmic point of view, the above theorem implies (see the
next two corollaries) that any planar graph is sparse: if m is its number
of edges and n is number of vertices, then m : 0(n) /

Let G : (V,E) be a graph and 'u € V such that dG('u) : 2 and

G is planar if and only if h(G) is planar.

Proof. “4:” Suppose that h(G) is planar.

If 11111112 ¢ E, then on the simple curve joining the points corresponding
to wl and 1112 in a planar representation of h(G) a new point is inserted
corresponding to 'u; if wl 1112 6 E we consider a new point corresponding
to 'u close “enough” to the curve representing 'lUl'LUg in one of the faces
of the planar representation of h(G) and "join" this new point to the
points corresponding to wl and 'LUg by simple curves disjoint from any
other edges. .

Proof cont’d. Observe that NG;L('w) is a cycle containing u'u (after a
simple sorting of N Gz(w) on m-coordinate, and using the maximal pla-
narity). It follows that i) and ii) hold for k; : n.
If 11k has been chosen (k; g n) then in G,’€_1 : G’ — {vn,...,vk}, the
neighbors of 'uk determine a path on the cycle Cléil containing u'u and

P

Proof cont’d. The parallel through wp to the ﬁrst bisector intersects the

parallel through wq to the second bisector in point P.

If from P we can draw the segments P'u/i, p g z' g q such that all are

distinct, then we can take 'Uk+l : P to obtain the Fary representation

of Gk+1 with all vertices having integer coordinates, satisfying the con-

ditions (1) - (3). J

—

Proof. Take to the maximum integer satisfying t g t1 and |L(t)| g \/H
(there is such a level since |L(O)| : 1). There exists t2 the minimum
integer satisfying t > t1 and |L(t2)| g J5 (note that |L(l + 1)| : O).
Any level between to and t2 has more than \/H vertices, therefore the
number of these levels is less than \/H (otherwise, the number of vertices
would be > n). U
Proof cont’d (Separator’s Theorem). Let
o: U L(t),D z U L(t),E I U L(t).
t<to t0<t<t2 t>t2
o |D| g (2/3)n. The theorem holds with S : L(t0) U L(t2), A the set
with a maximum cardinality among C’, D, E and B the union of
the remaining two sets (C and E have at most n / 2 elements). ‘

Exercise 4. The crossing number, cr(-), of a graph is the minimum
number of crossings occuring when the graph is drawn in the plane

non-vertex point). Find the crossing number of the following graphs:
K373, K5, K6, and the Petersen's graph.

Exercise 5. Use Kuratowski’s theorem to ﬁnd out which of the following
graphs are planar:

The 1/J-image of the embedding of G on the sphere, ¢( G), is the required
planar representation of G. U J
Let G be a plane graph. If we delete the points of G (its vertices and
edges) from the plane, this is decomposed into a ﬁnite union of maximal
connected regionsa of the plane, which are called the faces of G.
Exactly one of these faces is unbounded and it is called the exterior
(outer) face.
Each face is characterised by the set of edges forming its boundary.
Every cycle of G divides the plane in exactly two connected regions,
hence every edge of a cycle belongs to exactly two boundaries (of two
faces).
A planar graph may have different planar representations.
WPOlHtS of a connected region can be joined by a
simple curve contained in that region.

Let G : (V, E) be a connected planar graph with n 2 3 vertices and
m edges. Then,

m g 3n — 6. /
Proof. Let G’ be a planar representation of G. If G’ has only one face,
then G is a tree, m : n — 1, and for n 2 3 the stated inequality holds.
If G’ has at least two faces, then each face F of G’ has in its boundary
the edges of a cycle GF (and maybe some other edges), and each such
edge belongs to exactly two faces. Any cycle of G’ has at least three
edges, hence

2m > Z length(C’F) > Z 3 : 3f : 3(m - n + 2),
F face of G’ F face of G’
which gives the stated inequality. D ,
—

Proof cont’d. “:>” Conversely, suppose that G is planar.

In its planar representation, delete the point corresponding to 'u and the

two curves corresponding to 'u'wl and 111112 are replaced by their union; if

wl'wz E E, then the simple curve corresponding to it is deleted. D

We denote by h*(G) the graph obtained from G by applying repeatedly

the h transformation until a graph without vertices of degree two is

obtained.

It follows that G is planar if and only if h*(G) is planar.

Two graphs G1 and G2 are homeomorphic if h*(G1) g h*(G2).

(Kuratowski, 1930) A graph is planar if and only if it has no subgraphs

homeomorphic to K5 or K33.

Proof cont’d. If C’ has no interior chords, then lemma trivially holds.
Otherwise, choose the pair (i, j) such that 'UZ"U]' is an interior chord of
C’ and

j-z' : min{k —l : k > 1+ 1, 11km € E(G’), 'uk'ul interior chord of 6"}.
Then, w : vi+1 is not incident with an interior chord: 'UZ'+1’UP with

z' + 1 < p < j cannot be an interior chord - by the choosing of the pair
(Lj), and 'UZ'+1'UZ with l < 2' or l > j is not an interior chord since it
must cross 'ui'uj. D

Proof cont’d.
(1) v1 has coordinates (0,0); 1/2 has coordinates (1,0), 2' g 2k — 4.
(2) If w1,w2,.. .,wm are the vertices of the cycle giving the exterior
face of G,’c, in a traversal from 'ul to 112 (wl : 111, wm : v2), then
:an <:z:w2 < <:r:wm.
(3) The edges wl U12, 11121113, . . . , wmnl'wm are straight line segments par-
allel with one of the two bisectors of the coordinate axis.
Condition (3) implies that Vi < j, the parallel through wl- to the ﬁrst

point with integer coordinates (wi and wj have integer coordinates).

o n1 : ID‘ > (2/3)n. If we could ﬁnd a separator of type 1/3 <—> 2/3
for D with at most 2J5 vertices, then we add it to L(t0) U L(t2) in
order to obtain a separator of cardinality at most 4J5, take as A
the union of the set of maximum cardinality between C’ and E with
the small part remained in D, and take as B the union of other two
remaining sets.

The separator for (the graph induced by) D can be constructed as fol-
lows: delete all the vertices of G which are not from D, excepting s
which is joined with all vertices of the level t0 + 1. The graph obtained
is denoted by D and is planar and connected. It has a spanning tree of
diameter at most 2\/H (any vertex is reached from s by a path of length
at most JR, as we prooved in the Lemma above). This tree is dfs tra-
versed in order to obtain the desired separator. Details (very nice) are
