(Hopcroft, Karp, 1973) Let G be a graph and I/(G) : s. The num-
ber of distinct integers in the sequence |P0|, |P1|, . . . , |P511| (Pi are the
minimum augmenting paths constructed by the above algorithm) is not
greater than Zlﬁj + 2. ,

IPTI é ZlT/(S —T)l +1 I 2H5 — ﬁl/(S — l8 — ﬁlﬂ +1 < Zlﬁl +3-
Hence, for every i < 1", |P¢| is one of Lﬁj + 1 odd integers not greater
than Zlﬁj + 1.
In the sub-sequence IP11,- . . , {P5111 there are at most s — 'r é Lﬁj + 1

there are no more than 2|_\/§] + 2 distinct integers. U ,

in G with 'u G Ci.

H has a perfect matching. Indeed, we show that for H the Hall's
property holds , implying the existence of matching M0 that saturates

Let A Q {Gl,...,Gm}. Then B : NH(A) Q SO, and by the construc-
tion of H, in the graph G we have no edge from a vertex 'u G SO — B
to a vertex 'w € Gi € A. Hence the odd connected components from A
remains odd connected components in G — B; hence q(G — B) 2 |A|

(Berge, 1959) M is a maximum cardinality matching in the graph G if

Proof. "2" Let M be a maximum cardinality matching in G. Suppose
that P is an augmenting path in G with respect to M.

Therefore ‘Ml : ]M*|. U
We get a strategy to ﬁnd a maximum cardinality matching:

let M be a matching in G (e. g., M = Q);

while (EIP augmenting path W. r. t. M) do

M a M AP;

end while
At each while iteration the cardinality of M increases by 1, therefore in
at most n / 2 iterations we obtain a matching without augmenting paths,
that is of maximum cardinality. It remains to implement the while
loop in polynomial time complexity. This was ﬁrstly done by Edmonds
(1965).

Proof. Let N : (MAP)AP’. Then MAN : PAP’ and |N| I |M|+2.
By Lemma 1, there are two edge-disjoint augmenting paths W. r. t.
M, P1 and P2, contained in M AN . Since P is a minimum augmenting
path W.r.t. M, we have lPAP’\ 2 ‘Pll + [le 2 2IP] and therefore
|Pl + \P’| — 2|P O P’\ 2 2lP]. U
Let us consider the following algorithm:

While (El augmenting paths w. r. t. Mi) do
let P1- a minimum augmenting path W.r.t. Mi;
Mi+1 k MiA-Pi;

Let P0, P1, . . . , PU(G)_1 be the sequence of minimum augmenting paths
constructed by this algorithm.

This result has been extended to arbitrary graphs by Micali and Vazirani
(1980) using an elaborate data structure to maintain the labels associ-
ated to vertices in order to construct minimum augmenting paths.
Consider the case of bipartite graphs: G : (S, T; E) and M G Mg.
Starting from one 0f the classes, say S, we consider the set of initial
extremities of augmenting paths S O E (M ). From each such vertex we
start, in parallel, the construction of alternating paths in a bfs manner.
The ﬁrst augmenting path obtained stop the construction, giving the
minimum length of an augmenting path. The set 73’ is obtained using
the labels and the adjacency lists in @(n + m)
Details are omitted, an example is given on the next slide. ,

Let G be agraph. Clearly, |M| g |G|/2, VM € Mg. A perfect matching
(or 1-factor) in G is a matching M With the property |M| : |G|/2 (i.
e., S(M) : V(G)).

A connected component of graph G is even (odd) if the number of its
vertices is even (odd). We denote by q(G) the number of odd connected
components of G. ,

Let G be a graph having a perfect matching. Clearly, each connected
component of G is even. Hence, q(G) : O; moreover, if S Q V(G),
then for each odd connected component of the graph G — S there exists
an edge in the perfect matching of the graph with an extremity in this
connected component and the other in S. Since the extremities of dif-
ferent edges are distinct, it follows that |S| 2 q(G — S). For S : Q, we
obtain q(G — Q) g O, hence q(G) : O.

it is sufficiently to show that G’ : [DAG satisﬁes (T)
Let S’ Q Di. If q(G’ — S’) > |S’|, then we get the following contradic-
tion:
Q(G—(30US’)) I q<G-s0)+q<G'—s'> I |s0|+q(G'—s') > ISoU$’|-

Let G = (V, E) be a graph and M E MG be a matching in G. l

such that {vinlvi,vivi+1}ﬁ M 75 Q, Vz' : 1, k — 1.

Note that, since M is a matching, if P is an alternating path w.r.t. M,

then from any two consecutive edges of P exactly one belongs to M (the

edges belong alternatively to M and E \ M)

In the following, when we will refer to a path P we will understand its

set of edges.

Proof. The necessity of condition (T) has been already observed in the
above discussion. We prove by induction on n : |G| that if a graph
G : (V, E) satisﬁes (T), then G has a perfect matching.
For n : 1, 2 the theorem obviously holds. In the inductive step, let G
be graph with n 2 3 vertices which satisﬁes (T) and suppose that any
graph G’ with lG’| < n which satisﬁes (T) has a perfect matching.
Let SO Q V(G) such that q(G — SO) : |SO| and maximal (with respect
to "Q") having the property that (T) holds with equality (i. e., for any
strictly superset S of SO we have q(G — S) < lSl).
Note that the family of subsets of V(G) for which (T) is satisﬁed with
equality is non-empty, and therefore SO exists (for each vertex 'uo which
is not a cut-vertex in its component, we have q(G — 110) : 1 : |{vo}|,
since each connected component is even and contains such a vertex '00).

Maximum Cardinality Matchings - Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm

By Lemma 1, there are s — r edge-disjoint augmenting
paths (vertex-disjoint paths are also edge-disjoint) contained in M AN .
It follows that at least one of them has at most [r/(s — r)l edges from
M. The length of this augmenting path is at most er/(s — TH + 1. D
Deﬁnition
Let M E Mg. A with respect to M in G is
an augmenting path of minimum length over all augmenting paths with
respect to M in G.
Lemma 3

Graph Algorithms — Lecture 7 November 15, 2024 19/37

Hence we have the following algorithm to ﬁnd a maximum cardinality
matching in G:
M <— I5;
repeat
ﬁnd 'P a maximal set of vertex-disjoint minimum augmenting paths
w.r.t. M;
for (P G 'P) do
M <- M AP;
end for
until (7D = z)
The time complexity of the above algorithm is (Oh/HA), where A is the
time needed for ﬁnding the set 73.
In the case of bipartite graphs, Hopcroft and Karp shown that this can
be obtained in 0(n + m) time and therefore the entire algorithm has
0(mﬂ) running time.
