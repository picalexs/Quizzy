Conversely, suppose that G is 3-colorable.
We can assume that c(b) : 3 and c(a) : 2 (otherwise, rename the

It follows that {c(u,),c(ﬂ,)} : {1,2}, Vi : Lin and c(aj) 6 {1,3},
Vj : W.
By Lemma 1 a), it follows that C({Uj1,'ll_7'2,'l)j3}) 75 2, Vj : W. This
means that, Vj : W, there is a 'Ujk E CJ- such that c(vJ-k) : 1.
Hence, deﬁning t : U —> {true,false} by

we obtain an assignment with the property that t(C'J-) : true, Vj :

Minimum cost ﬂows
Deﬁnition ‘
Let a; be a flovv in R : (G, s, t, c) and a : E —> 1R a cost function.
o If P is an A-path in R vv.r.t. x, then the P is
deﬁned as
“(13) I Z at — Z at

o If C is a closed A-path in R W.r.t. x, then a(C) is computed using
the above equation, after establishing a direction of traversal of C
(it is possible that C’ is an A-path W.r.t. :1: in both directions). ,
Remarks ‘
0 If P is an augmenting path W.r.t. a3, then $1 I a: ® T(P) is a ﬂow
of value 21(121) : 1/(m) + r(P) and cost a(:z:1) : a(:17) +r(P) - a(P).

restricting only to instances with k : 3, is NP-hard, too.

Memento
o In order to prove that a certain decision problem is NP-complete:
I. First you have to show that the problem is in the class NP which
means: there exists a polynomial time certiﬁcate for a any solution-
candidate (for 3COL: given a function c : V(G) —> N, we can verify
if c is a coloring and uses at most three colors in (9(n2)).

II. Second, we must polynomially reduce a known NP-complete prob-
lem to your decision problem (for 3COL: e. g. BSAT can be poly-
nomially reduced to BOOL).

o If step I. misses, then the decision problem in sight is NP-hard.

Each cycle G of D corresponds to a cycle in G and conversely, each

Note that if G is a cycle of G, then this is generated by a cycle G’ of

D, and length(G) : 3- length(G’)+ length(G’) : 4 - length(G’). It

follows that any cycle of G is even, therefore G is a bipartite graph.

Instance: G a graph, k; E N.

Question: Has G a path P such that length(P) 2 k?

Prove that LPL is NP-complete.

Exercise 7. A kernel in a digraph G : (V, E) is a stable set S Q V such

that V u E V \ S exists 'u 6 S with vu 6 E. We consider the following

decision problem:

KERNEL

Instance: G a digraph.

Question: Has G a kernel?

Prove that the following construction leads to a polynomial reduction of

SAT to KERNEL (i.e. SAT gp KERNEL):
